# Deep-Learning-Model-for-Flower-Recognition

This project involved successfully developing an image classification application tailored to recognize different species of flowers. Using a dataset of flower images, a deep learning model was trained and initially tested in a Jupyter notebook. The code was then converted into a Python script for command-line execution. The project encompassed image preprocessing, model training, and prediction, resulting in a robust application capable of accurately classifying various flower species and laying the groundwork for future image recognition tasks.
